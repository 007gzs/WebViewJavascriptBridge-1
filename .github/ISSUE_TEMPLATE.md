# Bug report:

Thanks for reporting an issue with WebViewJavascriptBridge!

Do these 4 things and I will fix your problem for you!

1: Go to https://github.com/marcuswestin/WebViewJavascriptBridge and click Fork.
2: Clone your fork, `cd` into it and run `make test`. All tests should pass!
3: Edit `Tests/WebViewJavascriptBridgeTests/BridgeTests.m` and create a new, failing test which demostrates your issue.
4: Create a pull request for https://github.com/marcuswestin/WebViewJavascriptBridge

That's it! I'll take it from there, and promise I'll fix your failing test ASAP.

If you don't do these 3 things then I can't help you effectively, and probably won't :)

Cheers,
@marcuswestin
